# Introduction

## What is Mewl?

Mewl is an esoteric programming language. It has syntax very similar to Lisp. Mewl can be very confusing, because many of its design choices I made, for example there are no concept of traditional number system in mewl, or there are no strings, no arrays, and cherry on top, you can not use any word except `mew` (Comments are exception).



## ðŸ¤” What,Why?

Well, 2 years ago in 2020, I created an esoteric programming language called [Mewmew](https://github.com/bauripalash/mewmew). It was just a fun and experimental language I made while tinkering with ANTLR, cause I was (am still) fascinated about programming languages, interpreter/compilers; how they work; how they basically become the medium of interaction between humans and computers and/or machines. But with ANTLR, I didn't actually learn much about compiler/interpreter construction. It just worked! No fun!
So, In the October of 2021, I started re-writing the whole thing from scratch with Rust. I was able to build a lexer; a basic parser; But then I realized, syntax of 'mewmew' is ugly. I hurts my eyes to look at a 'mewmew' source code.
Again in, March 2022, I started experimenting with mewmew lanugage but with lisp style syntax, 'cause lisp is awesome. So, here is the result, **Mewl** , mewmew reborn with the syntax similar to lisp. Most important thing, I am having fun while developing mewl, and the syntax doesn't hurt my eyes that much.
